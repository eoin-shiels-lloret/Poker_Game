# Poker_Game

Welcome to my first project ever in GitHub, i have just started my 2nd year of ComSci at Dublin City University (DCU).

Its a small poker game against a computer (checkout master branch)

I will be creating this all in vim and be push / pulling from terminal so i can learn git better

The goals of this project are:

1. To be able to play a game of poker against a bot with a basic betting system (Fold, Call, Raise and Check)
2. To be able to keep tally of money/chips in between hands
3. To create a small blind / big blind system (With the exception of the player will always go first)
4. To create a small gui with basic images of some components of the game
5. To use at least one algorithm that i have learned (or will learn in the coming weeks)
